{"name":"Poshcode","tagline":"PowerShell Module for Module Packaging, Sharing, Finding, Installing","body":"PoshCode's purpose is to make it easier to distribute modules and scripts over the internet or within local and corporate networks.  **With this new project we are focusing on making it easy to distribute modules without explaining module installation to your users.**  Additionally, we're supporting the automatic installation of dependencies, so that you can distribute modules which have a dependency on other modules without having to worry about how your users will find and install them.\r\n\r\nThe module has two main commands for users, and a third for module developers:\r\n\r\n1. Find-Module (searches various module registries and repositories)\r\n2. Install-Module (installs modules from local packages or .zip files, or from URLs or UNC paths)\r\n3. Compress-Module (create a redistributable module package from a module on your system)\r\n\r\n### To install the PoshCode module, run one of these two command lines:\r\n\r\n```posh\r\n    # Install by downloading and executing the installer:\r\n    iwr 'http://PoshCode.org/I' -OutF PC.ps1; .\\PC; rm .\\PC.ps1\r\n\r\n    # Install from WebDAV share:\r\n    \\\\PoshCode.org\\Modules\\Install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe rest of the documentation is on the wiki, broken into several sections:\r\n\r\n1. [Installing Modules](https://github.com/PoshCode/poshcode/wiki/Installing-Modules)\r\n2. [Creating Module Packages](https://github.com/PoshCode/poshcode/wiki/Creating-Module-Packages)\r\n3. [Distributing Module Packages](https://github.com/PoshCode/poshcode/wiki/Distributing-Module-Packages)\r\n4.
